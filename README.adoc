This Capybara style guide outlines the recommended best practices for real-world programmers to write code that can be maintained by other real-world programmers.

https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop[RuboCop], a static code analyzer (linter) and formatter, has a https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-capybara[`rubocop-capybara`] extension, provides a way to enforce the rules outlined in this guide.

You can generate a PDF copy of this guide using https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/[AsciiDoctor PDF], and an HTML copy https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-documents/#converting-a-document-to-html[with] https://asciidoctor.org/#installation[AsciiDoctor] using the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Generates README.pdf
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read README.adoc

# Generates README.html
asciidoctor README.adoc
----

[TIP]
====
Install the `rouge` gem to get nice syntax highlighting in the generated document.

[source,shell]
----
gem install rouge

== A Living Document

This guide is work in progress - trying to fill in the arguments by which the rubocop-capbyara cops were written so that users can undestand the tradeoffs on different approaches (whether to configure, enable or disable different cops)  and understand where it's a question of consistency and/or style, or are there other issues at play.

== Using Capybara

=== Use a specific click_link or click_button to surface accessibility issues[[click-link-or-button-specificity]]
(corresponds to Capybara/ClickLinkOrButtonStyle)

=== But if you do use a generic click then use a consistent method[[click-link-or-button-consistency]]
(also corresponds to Capybara/ClickLinkOrButtonStyle)

=== Don't set expectations on Capybara `current_path`
(corresponds to Capybara/CurrentPathExpectation)

=== Don't use deprecated style methods
(corresponds to Capybara/MatchStyle)

=== Either use of `have_no_*` or use `not_to` consistently for negated expectations[[negation-matcher-consistency]]
(corresponds to Capybara/NegationMatcher)

=== Be concise: don't use redundant withins[[no-redundant-within-finds]]
(corresponds to Capybara/RedundantWithinFind)

=== Be specific: Use the most specific action rather than a generic action with parameters.[[specific-action]]
(corresponds to Capybara/SpecificActions)

=== Be specific: Use the most specific finder rather than a generic finder with parameters[[specific-finder]]
(corresponds to Capybara/SpecificFinders)

=== Be specific: Use the most specific matcher rather than a generic matcher with parameters[[specific-matcher]]
(corresponds to Capybara/SpecificMatcher)

=== Don't use visible: false in Capybara finders, instead use a specific visibility symbol[[visibility-matcher-specificity]]
(corresponds to Capybara/VisibilityMatcher)

== Using Capybara with RSpec

=== Use `have_css` or `have_xpath` instead of `have_selector`[[dont-use-have-selector]]
(corresponds to Capybara/RSpec/HaveSelector)

=== Prefer using predicate matcher over using predicate method directly[[predicate-matcher-rather-than-method]]
(corresponds to Capybara/RSpec/PredicateMatcher)
